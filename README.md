# Alchemy Laboratory
> This is my minimal alchemical laboratory, for coding in my current stack.

This repository resides my actual stack of development, and studies cases. The environment can change drastically, dependent of my state of mind. :grimacing:

If you share a alchemical stack like this one. Feel free to fork/clone, and made your changes. (And transumate wonderful things!!!)

## Why Vagrant?

I use Vagrant since 2012, and I feel confortable to use. (Yes, I've used vagrant and docker together)
